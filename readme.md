Buildings are the single largest energy consumer in Europe
85% of buildings in the EU were built before 2000 and 75% have poor energy performance. Improving the energy performance of existing buildings is therefore key to saving energy, reducing bills for citizens and enterprises, and achieving a zero-emission and fully decarbonised building stock by 2050. Yet the annual energy renovation rate remains very low at 1%.

EPBD gradually introduces minimum energy performance standards
